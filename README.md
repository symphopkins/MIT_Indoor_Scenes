![MIT Indoor Scenes](https://github.com/symphopkins/MIT_Indoor_Scenes/blob/main/indoor_scenes.png)


## Overview
This project aims to classify indoor scene images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and transfer learning. The dataset consists of images belonging to various indoor scene categories, and the goal is to train models that can accurately predict the category of a given indoor scene image.

## Files Included
- `Sentiment140.py`: Python script containing the code.
- `Sentiment140.ipynb`: Google Colab Notebook containing the detailed code implementation and explanations.
- `requirements.txt`: Text file listing the required Python packages and their versions.
-`LICENSE.txt`: Text file containing the license information for the project.

## Installation
To run this project, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can install the required dependencies using the `requirements.txt` file.

## Usage
1. Ensure that you have installed all dependencies as described in the Installation section.
2. Prepare your indoor scene dataset. The dataset should be organized into subdirectories, each representing a different indoor scene category.
3. Modify the `img_dir` variable in the Python script to point to the directory containing your dataset.
4. Run the Python script to train and evaluate the indoor scene classification models.

## Data Source
The dataset used for this project is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/itsahmad/indoor-scenes-cvpr-2019).
